## Hi there! 👋 I'm Luke Canepari

I'm an aspiring game developer with a passion for writing, world-building, and creating fun, memorable multiplayer experiences!

- 🔭 **Currently Working On:** I'm using **GameMaker Studio** to build a game project called **The Logos Anomaly**, A 2D top down survival RPG with a sci-fi horror/thriller setting. I'm hoping to soon release a free demo meant to showcase the core gameplay before I start working on the prologue.

- 🏆 **Recent Achievement:** I've recently graduated with a **Bachelor’s degree in English** and a **minor in Computer Programming**.
  
- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** Back-end development, specifically **JavaScript** and **MySQL**. I've already gained a strong foundation in front-end development, and I’m excited to deepen my understanding of how everything connects!

- 👯 **Current Collaboration:** I'm working on a project called **Typing-Champion**, which I hope will become my first fully published website!

- 🤔 **Looking for Help With:** AI and **game development**—especially insights into the industry. While I’ve built small, simple games before, I’m now working on a **larger project using the GameMaker engine**.

- 💬 **Let’s Talk About:**  
  If you’re looking for someone with both **coding expertise** and a passion for **creative writing, technical writing, and graphic design**, I’d love to chat! I also have experience with **UI/UX design**, and creating intuitive, visually appealing GUIs is one of my favorite aspects of front-end work.
