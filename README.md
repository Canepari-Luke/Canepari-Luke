I'm an aspiring game developer with a passion for writing, world-building, and creating fun, memorable multiplayer experiences!

  If you’re looking for someone with both **coding expertise** and a passion for **creative writing, technical writing, and graphic design**, I’d love to chat! I also have experience with **UI/UX design**, and creating intuitive, visually appealing GUIs is one of my favorite aspects of front-end work.
